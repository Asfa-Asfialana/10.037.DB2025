# 👋 Hello and Welcome!

Hello! Welcome to my **Practice and Projects** repository.

I am a beginner in coding, and I am very enthusiastic about learning new things. This repository is created to document the exercises I have undertaken from Eco Technology Leader and to showcase the projects I plan to work on in the future.

As a novice, I find learning to code incredibly enjoyable—it feels like having a conversation with a computer. Every time I input a formula or code and see it executed correctly, it brings a unique sense of satisfaction. Of course, errors occur frequently, but they are part of the learning journey.
